Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The customer was a business named DriverPass, which sought to develop resources to assist individuals in passing their driving tests on their first try. 
Their goal was to create a system with tiers of users that could each access different kinds of content.
Additionally, the users would be able to arrange for in-person instruction from qualified teachers and for in-person training. 
All of this was supposed to be managed by this system, which also gives administrators access to other features like the ability to disable products they no longer wish to offer.

What did you do particularly well?

I think that for this project, I did a very good job of condensing the requirements into use cases. Using the interview notes, 
I created use cases and described the links between include and extend. I also made a map of who would be able to access what features, and I think it turned out rather nicely.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Most certainly, I would alter my sequence diagram. To make a better one, I would learn more about them and how to make them. 
The reason for this is that I think I have two "alternative" sections within a parent "alternative" section. 
This would be the equivalent of nested loops in code, though I'm not sure if that's even appropriate to include in a sequence diagram. 
I would attempt to break this down into discrete options and apply a more thorough process flow throughout.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I began by reading the transcript of the interview in its entirety. I took notes on everything they said that I could use as a deliverable. After 
I had a complete list, I began to consider if those were external requirements or how they would be completed using software. If the demand was external,
I would put it on the back burner and concentrate on the ones where I could clearly see the software being used.
To get the appropriate answer, I relied on study whenever I came across abstract needs like "security" in general.I then had to include them into the design.
I created use cases for them after attempting to deconstruct them into the simplest activities I could. I then reinserted the include and extend relationships to add further complexity. 
When creating, it is crucial to consider the needs of the consumer because you want to create what they have truly asked for.
One instance from this project would be the content that is downloadable and restricted to specific users. 
It would just be content that anyone could download if I didn't include a password or a tiered user system, which would negate their entire justification for providing "premium" content. 
Designing with the needs of the user in mind will keep your clients satisfied and save you a ton of rework down the road.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I am still learning the software development process. I make an effort to read over all of the requirements first and make a checklist of the things I think are most important. 
I then attempt to separate the various components of the system and their interactions. I either just write them down to go on to a process diagram before returning to a class diagram,
or I utilize a UML class diagram for this. After I at last have a class diagram and a process diagram, I start coding the program.
Making the illustrations makes it easier for me to think of things that I might overlook if I started coding right away. However, there are moments when you're pressed for time at school. 
Too often in those situations, I just get right into the coding. I think I'll utilize the activity diagram a lot more in the future to describe how functions should operate. 
They, in my opinion, are really helpful in ensuring that your function performs as intended.
